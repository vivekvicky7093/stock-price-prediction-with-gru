**Introduction**

Stock price forecasting is an essential task in financial analysis, helping investors make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks. This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Asian Paints, one of India's leading paint companies, using machine learning models.


**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for Asian Paints, including features such as date, open, high, low, close, volume, etc. The data was sourced from [provide source].

**Getting Started**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asian-paints-stock-forecasting.git

Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent various preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and outlier detection and treatment.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and understand its distribution, relationships, and patterns. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices, and time series plots were used for analysis.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involved creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. This included generating calendar features, calculating price change ratios, and performing seasonal decomposition.

Model Building
Several machine learning models were considered for stock price forecasting, including ARIMA, moving average, GRU, and LSTM. The models were trained, evaluated, and compared based on their performance metrics.

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Results
Based on the evaluation results, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model was chosen for its superior performance in forecasting Asian Paints' stock prices.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques for stock price forecasting. The GRU model proved to be effective in predicting Asian Paints' stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors.
